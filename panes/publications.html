      <p class="abstract">We numerically simulate the uniform athermal shearing of bidisperse, frictionless, two-dimensional spherocylinders and three-dimensional prolate ellipsoids. We focus on the orientational ordering of particles as an asphericity parameter \(\alpha \rightarrow 0\) and particles approach spherical. We find that the nematic order parameter \(S_2\) is nonmonotonic in the packing fraction \(\phi\) and that, as \(\alpha \rightarrow 0\), \(S_2\) stays finite at jamming and above. The approach to spherical particles thus appears to be singular. We also find that sheared particles continue to rotate above jamming and that particle contacts preferentially lie along the narrowest width of the particles, even as \(\alpha \rightarrow 0\).</p>

      <p class="abstract">We present a detailed study of cooperative and correlated dynamics in a 2D model system for soft active matter that undergoes motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). Particle displacement correlation functions reveal increasing dynamical heterogeneity with increasing activity. In the phase-separated regime as well as in the truly glassy phase, transverse mean squared displacements as well as shear strain correlations exhibit a regime of long-range behaviour with strain correlations decaying as \(r^{−2}\) on time scales short compared to the rotational diffusion time. We attribute the origin of the \(r^{−2}\) decay to elastic interactions that lead to similar behaviour in passive glass formers.</p>
